## Project Idea

I used to travel a lot and sometimes the net goes off so I always had to manually download my favorite youtube songs and content from third-party websites. So I thought of making a cli tool to help me with the issue. Here is the project. But it is in beta version so you might find a lots of bug. Please let me know I'll fix them.

Happy DowTube!
