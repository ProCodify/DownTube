## Project Idea 💡

DownTube was born out of the need to have offline access to my favorite YouTube songs while traveling, especially when the internet was unreliable. I used to manually download content from third-party websites, which was a hassle. To simplify the process, I created this tool. It's currently in beta, so you may encounter some bugs. If you do, please let me know, and I'll work on fixing them.

Happy Downloading with DownTube! 🎶📦 #DownTube
